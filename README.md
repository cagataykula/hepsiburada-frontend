# Hepsiburada Search Page

This is a test case for Hepsitech.

## Summary

I know Vue.js and i could made this case easiliy with Vue.js but i wanted to try myself in React.js. Because of that i used React.js for Frontend. I used Express.js for backend. I couldnt figured out how i'm gonna do filters for page. Firstly i tried to manage filters from backend but i thought it would take time. Right now, backend is only providing mock data for frontend with search by keyword feature. All filters is managing by frontend.

I didnt used any css library. Page is not responsive. But if we check hepsiburada.com it's not responsive too. It is preparing and providing page by client's screen resolution.


# Run Project


Write `docker-compose up` in terminal. Frontend and backend will run thanks to docker.

Check this out in the browser: http://localhost:3005. You'll see frontend.

## Tests

Once i wrote test in a project. I wanted to write for this project but i couldn't have time. So i didn't write any tests.
